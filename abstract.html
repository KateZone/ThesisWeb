    <p>In order to deal with the impacts of climate change, the world has begun to actively shift toward clean methods of energy consumption. China is also actively promoting this energy revolution. Although the central government has repeatedly stressed the importance of energy policy, it has so far had less than the desired effect. The purpose of this paper is to find out the obstacles within China's local energy governance and put forward feasible suggestions for China's energy governance.

    <p>In this paper, Hangzhou and Shenyang, two representative cities of North and South China, respectively, are selected for case studies. Through quantitative analysis, this paper calculates the per capita carbon emission, urbanization status, the relationship between economic development and energy consumption of Hangzhou, which is in the first batch of green low-carbon pilot cities, and Shenyang, which is in the third batch of green low-carbon cities. Through qualitative analysis, this paper finds that local protectionism, the promotion mechanism for local officials and the lack of motivation for energy reform in state-owned enterprises are the three major obstacles to good energy governance. In view of these obstacles of energy governance, the corresponding suggestions are put forward.

    <p>First, by analyzing the successful experience of energy governance in California and London, this paper concludes that China can learn from California's energy governance experience by increasing the proportion of clean energy in the local energy consumption structure by carrying out a structural transformation and getting rid of the coal-based energy consumption structure. These goals can be reached by actively promoting the reform of state-owned enterprises to reduce local protectionism through increased market reforms used to guide energy prices, supply and demand, making energy information transparent, and increasing the scope of public participation and supervision. Furthermore, placing environmental governance (through a renewable energy percentage) as the most important indicator of official performance evaluation can improve public environmental supervision and the evaluation system. Finally, due to the continuous improvement of China's urbanization rate, consistent building and industry energy efficiency standards should be codified.

    <p>Through this study, this paper also found that legal system issues may be an important reason for local protectionism, but this subject is a bit outside the purview of this paper. However, itâ€™s worth noting that improvement of the legal system may help to improve the status of local energy governance.

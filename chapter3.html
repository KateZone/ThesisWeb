    <title>Energy Governance and Economic Development in Shenyang</title>

    <h3>3.1.2 Energy Governance and Economic Development</h3>

    <p>Affected by the overall economic downturn, the total energy consumption of large-scale industries in Shenyang has been decreasing continuously since 2012. The total energy consumption in 2015 was only 74.7% of that in 2011, and the energy consumption per unit GDP also decreased year over year. As such, it’s clear that Shenyang's energy consumption is affected by GDP.</p>

    <p>Shenyang’s GDP in 2019 was 647.03 billion yuan, an increase of 4.2% over the previous year when adjusted for inflation. The added value of industries accounted for 4.4% of GDP; the secondary industry 33.7%, and the tertiary industry 61.9% (Shenyang Statistic Bureau, 2020).</p>

    <p>In 2020, the city's GDP reached 657.16 billion yuan, with a year-on-year growth of 0.8% after adjusting for inflation. By industry, the added value of the primary industry was 30.36 billion yuan, up 2.9% year on year; the secondary industry was 216.04 billion yuan, up 2.9%; and the tertiary industry was 410.76 billion yuan, down 0.6% (Shenyang Statistic Bureau, 2021).</p>

    <p>Therefore, the relationship between economic growth and energy consumption in Shenyang is clear. The economy of Shenyang is a non-energy-dependent economy, which corresponds to its industrial structure as a proportion of GDP.</p>

    <p>The development trend of Shenyang's GDP and industrial structure from 2011 to 2019 is shown below.</p>

    <p>The emerging market economy has a serious impact on entities that flourished during the planned economy. In the planned economy era, energy supply was unidirectional, with low and stable prices. During the dual-track system, state-owned enterprises could enjoy energy subsidies. However, after these subsidies were canceled, energy types and prices were set by supply and demand.</p>

    <p>More than half of the users now pay individually for heating, leading to a shift from centralized to decentralized heating. Shenyang has a coal-dependent energy consumption structure, with coal accounting for about 60% of energy use. Direct combustion of raw coal, with 37% of coal usage having sulfur content over 1%, contributes heavily to CO2 emissions and environmental issues.</p>

    <p>Many cities in China, like Shenyang, face domestic pressure to reduce carbon emissions. Achieving peak carbon emissions is crucial for sustainable economic growth, requiring a decoupling of CO2 emissions from economic growth.</p>

    <h4>Kaya’s Equation</h4>
    <p>According to Kaya’s famous equation (Kaya, 1990):</p>
    <p><strong>CO<sub>2</sub> Emission = Population × GDP/Population × Energy Consumption/GDP × CO<sub>2</sub> Emission/Energy Consumption</strong></p>

    <p>Without major adjustments in energy sector and efficiency, there will be a linear relationship between energy consumption and CO2 emissions, with carbon intensity constant. Therefore, <strong>CO<sub>2</sub> Emission/Energy Consumption = E</strong>, where E = 2.45.</p>

    <p>Shenyang has made some progress in reducing CO2 emissions per capita. However, it is still dependent on high-pollution industries for economic growth, with local governments prioritizing these sectors to meet GDP targets.</p>

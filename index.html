        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>In order to deal with the impacts of climate change, the world has begun to actively shift toward clean methods of energy consumption. China is also actively promoting this energy revolution. Although the central government has repeatedly stressed the importance of energy policy, it has so far had less than the desired effect. The purpose of this paper is to find out the obstacles within China's local energy governance and put forward feasible suggestions for China's energy governance.

        <p>In this paper, Hangzhou and Shenyang, two representative cities of North and South China, respectively, are selected for case studies. Through quantitative analysis, this paper calculates the per capita carbon emission, urbanization status, the relationship between economic development and energy consumption of Hangzhou, which is in the first batch of green low-carbon pilot cities, and Shenyang, which is in the third batch of green low-carbon cities. Through qualitative analysis, this paper finds that local protectionism, the promotion mechanism for local officials and the lack of motivation for energy reform in state-owned enterprises are the three major obstacles to good energy governance. In view of these obstacles of energy governance, the corresponding suggestions are put forward.

        <p>First, by analyzing the successful experience of energy governance in California and London, this paper concludes that China can learn from California's energy governance experience by increasing the proportion of clean energy in the local energy consumption structure by carrying out a structural transformation and getting rid of the coal-based energy consumption structure. These goals can be reached by actively promoting the reform of state-owned enterprises to reduce local protectionism through increased market reforms used to guide energy prices, supply and demand, making energy information transparent, and increasing the scope of public participation and supervision. Furthermore, placing environmental governance (through a renewable energy percentage) as the most important indicator of official performance evaluation can improve public environmental supervision and the evaluation system. Finally, due to the continuous improvement of China's urbanization rate, consistent building and industry energy efficiency standards should be codified.

        <p>Through this study, this paper also found that legal system issues may be an important reason for local protectionism, but this subject is a bit outside the purview of this paper. However, it’s worth noting that improvement of the legal system may help to improve the status of local energy governance.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Through empirical analysis, this paper studies the current situation of China's local energy governance and the characteristics of the central government's energy governance in different periods. It also analyzes the main energy policies of the central government after 2006 and calculates the progress of these main energy policies.
            On the one hand, this paper explores the reason for why the Chinese central government constant emphasis on energy transformation and constant introduction of policies on environmental protection still lead to ineffective implementation. On the other hand, through the research, this paper constructs an analysis framework of energy governance obstacles and puts forward suggestions for China's energy governance based on the successful experience of energy governance in London and California.
            The value of this paper is to fill the gap in that previous energy governance research mostly focused on the western and eastern regions, which resulted in the lack of comparative studies between northern and southern cities. As such, this paper selected Shenyang and Hangzhou, which are both green low-carbon pilot cities. However, they have very different historical development backgrounds and population density. In the case studies, urbanization, economic structure, the relationship of energy consumption and economic development, carbon emission intensity were examined. Furthermore, through quantitative analysis the research calculates the per capita carbon emissions of Shenyang and Hangzhou and evaluates the governance results of carbon emission reductions at the present stage, the relationship between energy consumption and economic development, and the impact of the urbanization process on energy consumption. Through qualitative analysis, the obstacles for energy policy governance were discovered. This paper finds that in the process of local energy governance, official promotion system, local protectionism and poor supervision are the main reasons why energy policies cannot be implemented effectively. First of all, due to China's national conditions, China's energy governance oscillated between centralization and decentralization, and GDP growth weighs heavily in the promotion evaluation of local officials. As such, it is necessary to change the existing official performance evaluation system, increase public participation and supervision, and replace GDP as primary performance evaluation standard. Secondly, the reform of state-owned enterprises is a process that must be promoted in the process of energy governance because state-owned enterprises have no motivation to improve energy efficiency and install clean energy, which has become an obstacle in the process of energy governance. Third, China can learn from California's new energy development experience to design more practical development policies for China's new energy development and change the coal-based energy consumption structure by designing renewables and energy efficiency policies. California's renewable portfolio standard policy can help China's energy transformation provide a step-by-step reference and is something which should be implemented at the highest level for local official promotion.
            Deficiencies of this paper include the fact that data sources used for quantitative calculations were limited, and the accuracy of the data needs to be verified. Because the data selected in this paper are from Yearbooks of China’s local governments and the central government, some statistical indicators of the central and local governments are inconsistent. Therefore, in future studies, selecting more comprehensive data and conducting field surveys will increase the measurement accuracy of said data.
